Children’s Service (K through 12)
Please sign in and sign out your kids at the registration desk by Conference room C4. Please do NOT drop off the kids more than 15 minutes before the meetings and pick up the kids right after the meeting. The toddlers will need to be accompanied by at least a parent in room C4 and an audio streaming will be provided. Junior high or older are expected to be in the main meeting unless they are serving with a parent. 

Security 
We share the hotel with other guests. There will be brothers ushering and patrolling the meeting area during the meetings. If you see any suspicious activity, please let the hotel front desk know or contact brother William Gould (951) 640-7545

Distribution Material
Those that have signed up for the Truth Sets Us Free (TSUF) distribution on Monday or Tuesday have received an email to pre-order the TSUF vests, hats, bags and other materials. You can pick up your pre-ordered items in front of the meeting room right before and after the meetings. Saints that plan on joining the Bible distribution on Monday or Tuesday that have not pre-ordered can do so now. The materials are primarily for the saints who will be joining the gospel trip. The left over materials will be available for sale after the last conference meeting on Lord’s Day at noon. If the materials run out, they will be available for order on materials.bfa.org.

Hotel and Area Info 
Check out time is 11 AM on Lord’s Day and Monday. Please check out before the Lord’s Day meeting or before the Monday distribution. You can request a late check out but it's not guaranteed for our group.
