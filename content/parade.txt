MLK Parade TSUF Distribution Information
We will be distributing BFA materials and Bibles on MLK day during the parade. We will be exercising our first amendment rights of free speech and will have the saints spread out in small groups. We ask saints to exercise your spirit and not block any traffic and follow the directions of the leading ones and the officers. Below are some general instructions and considerations 
1.	Saints who want to participate in the distribution should come to the meeting on Lord’s Day TSUF Coordination Meeting at 4 pm
2.	We want to have small groups and each group should be able to fit into a car or van. We encourage saints to find some companions and form groups and work out rides. Ideal group size is around 5 saints. We can help group the saints on Lord’s Day. 
3.	Each team can pick up around 50 Bibles, 50 Basic Elements of the Christian Life, vol. 1, and 50 Spiritual Nourishment books at the coordination meeting on Lord’s Day. We also encourage you to purchase T shirts and bags 
4.	We recommend that you check out of the hotel early and try and go downtown and park by 9 AM and stay there until 11 am or noon or until you pass out all the materials.   You can park on the street for free or at one of the lots. We recommend saints spread out along King street. You can also ask the hotel about late check out on Monday.
