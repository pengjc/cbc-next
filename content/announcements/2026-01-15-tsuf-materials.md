**Important:** Pre-order of The Truth Sets Us Free materials

As part of the inaugural event of The Truth Sets Us Free, we have prepared vests, messenger bags, hats, and other materials for purchase. The clothing will be especially important since we will not have tables and banners and will be going out based on our First Amendment rights to speak to people and pass out Bibles and ministry books.

The messenger bags make it easier to pass things out compared to keeping everything in a backpack. Our hope is that these items will be used again and often this entire year. All the materials are available for pre-order at:

Priority will be given to the saints who plan on joining the gospel trip after the conference. You will need to create an account if you have not already, and there is an approval process which will be expedited for the conference. The orders will be fulfilled after Meeting 2 of the conference, and unsold materials will be made available to all saints at that time.
