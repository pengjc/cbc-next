The original room block was only for the nights Friday 1/16 and Saturday 1/17 for the price of $153 per night plus taxes. The hotel will add those reservations to our event to offset any shortfall from our contract. Please help us by giving us the information for any reservations made outside the room block. Please fill out a separate form for each separate reservation made.</p>\n<p>Link to form:\n<a href=\"https://forms.gle/wYLmmcPSUNm84WSM6\">https://forms.gle/wYLmmcPSUNm84WSM6</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> Pre-order of The Truth Sets Us Free materials</p>\n<p>As part of the inaugural event of The Truth Sets Us Free, we have prepared vests, messenger bags, hats, and other materials for purchase. The clothing will be especially important since we will not have tables and banners and will be going out based on our First Amendment rights to speak to people and pass out Bibles and ministry books.</p>\n<p>The messenger bags make it easier to pass things out compared to keeping everything in a backpack. Our hope is that these items will be used again and often this entire year. All the materials are available for pre-order at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://materials.bfa.org/collections/the-truth-sets-us-free\">https://materials.bfa.org/collections/the-truth-sets-us-free</a></p>\n<p>Priority will be given to the saints who plan on joining the gospel trip after the conference. You will need to create an account if you have not already, and there is an approval process which will be expedited for the conference. The orders will be fulfilled right before or after Meeting 2 of the conference, and unsold materials will be made available to all saints at that time.</p>\n",
