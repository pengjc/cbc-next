# Hotel Room Commitment

**Important:** We have a contracted minimum number of rooms with the hotel. If we don't fill these rooms, we will face financial penalties.

## If You Need to Cancel

If circumstances change and you cannot attend:

1. **First**, try to find someone else who can take your room
2. **If that's not possible**, email us at info@carolinasblendingconference.org with your cancellation request
3. We will add your room to the waitlist and offer it to others who need accommodation

Your cooperation helps us avoid penalties. Thank you!
